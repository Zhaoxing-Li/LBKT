### Here is an example of how the x array is created for a sample in the BERTDataset class:

Suppose we have the following data for a user:
- content_ids: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- answered_correctly: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

This data represents a sequence of 5 content IDs and the corresponding answered correctly values for each content ID. To create the x array for this sample, we would first shift the content IDs and answered correctly values by one:
- content_ids: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
- answered_correctly: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]

Next, we would add the answered correctly values to the content IDs to get the x array: x: [0, 1, 3, 4, 4]

In this example, x is an array of length 5, with the first element being 0, the second element being 1, the third element being 3, the fourth element being 4, and the fifth element being 4. This array represents the input data for the BERT model for this sample. The BERT model will take this array as input and produce an output that is used to calculate the model's loss and accuracy.


### why do we need to shift the content IDs and answered correctly values by one?
The content IDs and answered correctly values are shifted by one because the BERT model is trained to predict the next content ID and answered correctly value in a sequence given the previous content IDs and answered correctly values in the sequence. Shifting the content IDs and answered correctly values by one ensures that the model is trained to predict the next item in the sequence, rather than simply memorizing the input data.

For example, suppose the model is given the input x array from the previous example and is asked to predict the next content ID and answered correctly value in the sequence. The model would use the input x array to produce an output, and this output would be compared to the true next content ID and answered correctly value in the sequence (i.e., the shifted content IDs and answered correctly values) to calculate the model's loss and accuracy. This allows the model to learn to make predictions based on the input data, rather than simply memorizing the input data.


### is the 'lable' and 'target_id' the same?
No, label and target_id are not the same. label is a tensor containing the "true" labels for the inputs, which are used to calculate the model's loss and accuracy. target_id is a tensor containing the "true" target IDs (i.e., the next content ID in the sequence) that are used as inputs to the BERT model. The model then produces an output that is compared to the label tensor to calculate the loss and accuracy.

### But in your provided code, the 'target_id' is not used as input to the BERT model
That is correct. In the provided code, the target_id tensor is not used as input to the BERT model. Instead, only the x tensor is used as input. This means that the BERT model is not being used to predict the next content ID in the sequence, but is being used for some other purpose (e.g., to predict whether a user will answer a question correctly or not).

### What's the 'x_input'
x_input is a tensor representing the input data for the BERT model. In the code you provided, x_input is created by unsqueezing the tensor x at the 0th dimension, which adds a size-1 dimension at the 0th position, effectively turning the tensor into a batch of size 1. This is necessary because the BERT model expects a batch of input data, rather than a single sample.

### My training batch size of my dataloader is 64, I think the batch_size of 'x_input' should also be 64?
x_input is a tensor containing the input data for a single training example. The batch size of the dataloader determines how many training examples are processed in a single step. So, x_input should have a batch size of 1, not 64.

### What's 'x'? 
```
# Assume the following values for the input parameters:
# n_skill = 100  # total number of skills/questions
# max_seq = 128  # maximum sequence length

# The user has answered 10 questions with the following IDs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# The user has answered the questions correctly as follows: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

x = np.zeros(max_seq-1, dtype=int)  # initialize the input sequence with zeros
x[:10] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # copy the question IDs into the first 10 elements of x
x[:10] += [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0] * n_skill  # add the correct answers to the corresponding elements of x

# The resulting value of x will be:
# [101, 2, 103, 4, 105, 6, 107, 8, 109, 10]
```

### Does 'x' consists of the content IDs for each sample shifted by one?
No, `x` does not consist of the content IDs for each sample shifted by one. `x` consists of the content IDs for the questions that were presented to the user before each sample, plus a binary indicator for whether the user answered each question correctly. The content IDs for the questions that are presented after each sample are stored in the `target_id` array, which is a separate array from `x`.

For example, if q and qa have the following values:
```
q = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
qa = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

x = [101, 2, 103, 4, 105, 6, 107, 8, 109, 10]
target_id = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
As you can see, the values in `x` consist of the content IDs for the questions that were presented to the user before each sample, plus a binary indicator for whether the user answered each question correctly (1 if the user answered correctly, 0 if the user answered incorrectly). The content IDs for the questions that were presented after each sample are stored in the `target_id` array.

### What's the difference of 'x' and 'target_id'?
x is a numpy array that contains the content IDs for the questions that were presented to the user before each sample, plus a binary indicator for whether the user answered each question correctly. x is used as the input to the model and the model uses the values in x to make predictions about the answers to the questions that were presented to the user.

target_id is a numpy array that contains the content IDs for the questions that were presented to the user after each sample. The values in target_id are not used as input to the model, but they are used to calculate the loss during training and to evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.

Here is an example to illustrate the difference between x and target_id:
```
# Assume the following values for the input parameters:
# q = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# qa = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
# n_skill = 100

# The values of x and target_id would be:
x = [101, 2, 103, 4, 105, 6, 107, 8, 109, 10]
target_id = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

### How does the SAKT model do with two inputs 'x' and 'target_id' 
The SAKTModel class is a PyTorch neural network that is used to train a student activity knowledge tracing (SAKT) model. The model uses a multi-head attention mechanism to learn the relationships between the student's responses to a sequence of questions and to make predictions about the student's knowledge of each skill (represented by a content ID in the input data). The model's architecture is similar to the BERT model, with a few modifications to make it suitable for the SAKT task.

The forward method of the SAKTModel class defines how the input data is processed by the network. It takes as input the student's responses to a sequence of questions (`x`) and the IDs of the questions that were presented to the student (`question_ids`). It first applies the embedding and pos_embedding layers to `x` to generate a sequence of vectors representing the student's responses and their positions in the input sequence. It then applies the `e_embedding` layer to `question_ids` to generate a sequence of vectors representing the questions that were presented to the student.

Next, the method uses the `multi_att` layer to compute attention weights for each student response, using the output of the `e_embedding` layer as the query and the output of the `embedding` and `pos_embedding` layers as the key and value, respectively. The attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the query vectors, which is then added to the output of the e_embedding layer and passed through the layer_normal layer.

The output of the attention layer is then passed through the `ffn` layer to generate a sequence of vectors representing the student's knowledge of each skill. Finally, the `pred` layer is applied to this sequence to make predictions about the student's knowledge of each skill. The method returns the predicted knowledge values and the attention weights computed by the `multi_att` layer.

### Line by line explanation of HawkesKT inter cross effects
```
def forward(self, feed_dict):
    skills = feed_dict['skill_seq']      # [batch_size, seq_len]
    problems = feed_dict['problem_seq']  # [batch_size, seq_len]
    times = feed_dict['time_seq']        # [batch_size, seq_len]
    labels = feed_dict['label_seq']      # [batch_size, seq_len]
```
This code extracts the skill sequence, problem sequence, time sequence, and label sequence from the input feed dictionary. The skill sequence and problem sequence are 2D tensors of size [batch_size, seq_len], where batch_size is the number of sequences in the batch and seq_len is the length of each sequence. The time sequence is a 2D tensor of the same size, and the label sequence is a 2D tensor of binary values indicating whether each problem was answered correctly (1) or incorrectly (0).

```
    mask_labels = labels * (labels > -1).long()
    inters = skills + mask_labels * self.skill_num
```
This code creates the intermediate skill sequence by masking the labels to only include the problems that were answered incorrectly, and then adding the skill_num to the corresponding skills in the skill sequence. The mask_labels tensor is created by setting all correct answers to 0 and all incorrect answers to 1, and then casting the resulting tensor to long type. The inters tensor is created by adding the skill_num to the skills in the skill sequence where the corresponding label in the mask_labels tensor is 1.

```
    alpha_src_emb = self.alpha_inter_embeddings(inters)  # [bs, seq_len, emb]
    alpha_target_emb = self.alpha_skill_embeddings(skills)
    alphas = torch.matmul(alpha_src_emb, alpha_target
    
    beta_src_emb = self.beta_inter_embeddings(inters)  # [bs, seq_len, emb]
    beta_target_emb = self.beta_skill_embeddings(skills)
    betas = torch.matmul(beta_src_emb, beta_target_emb.transpose(-2, -1))  # [bs, seq_len, seq_len]
    betas = torch.clamp(betas + 1, min=0, max=10)
```
This code calculates the embeddings for the intermediate skills and the current skills, and then uses these embeddings to calculate the coefficients alphas and betas. The alpha_src_emb tensor is created by passing the intermediate skills through the alpha_inter_embeddings layer, which is an embedding layer that maps the intermediate skills to a low-dimensional space. The alpha_target_emb tensor is created in a similar way using the alpha_skill_embeddings layer and the current skills. The alphas tensor is then calculated
```
    delta_t = (times[:, :, None] - times[:, None, :]).abs().double()
    delta_t = torch.log(delta_t + 1e-10) / np.log(self.time_log)
```
This code calculates the time difference between each pair of problems in the sequence. The delta_t tensor is created by subtracting the time of each problem from the time of every other problem, and then taking the absolute value of the result. The resulting tensor has size [batch_size, seq_len, seq_len]. The delta_t tensor is then log-transformed and normalized by dividing by the log of the time_log parameter.

```
  cross_effects = alphas * torch.exp(-betas * delta_t)
```
This code calculates the cross-effects for each pair of problems in the sequence. The cross-effects are a measure of the influence of each skill on the prediction of the current problem. The cross_effects tensor is calculated by multiplying the alphas tensor (which captures the strength of the influence) by the exponential of the negative of the product of the betas tensor (which captures the decay of the influence over time) and the delta_t tensor (which captures the time difference between the two problems).

```
    seq_len = skills.shape[1]
    valid_mask = np.triu(np.ones((1, seq_len, seq_len)), k=1)
    mask = (torch.from_numpy(valid_mask) == 0)
    mask = mask.cuda() if self.gpu != '' else mask
    sum_t = cross_effects.masked_fill(mask, 0).sum(-2)
```
This code masks the upper triangle of the cross_effects tensor (including the diagonal) to zero and then sums the remaining elements along the last dimension. The resulting sum_t tensor has size [batch_size, seq_len] and represents the cumulative influence of all the previous problems on the prediction of the current problem.

The valid_mask is an array with the same shape as the cross_effects tensor, which is [batch_size, seq_len, seq_len]. The valid_mask array has all elements set to 1 except for the elements in the upper triangle of the array (including the diagonal), which are set to 0. The valid_mask array is used to mask the elements of the cross_effects tensor that correspond to the upper triangle of the array, setting them to zero.

The sum_t tensor is a tensor of size [batch_size, seq_len] that represents the cumulative influence of all the previous problems on the prediction of the current problem. The sum_t tensor is created by summing the elements of the cross_effects tensor along the last dimension (i.e., summing over the second skill index). The mask tensor is created by converting the valid_mask array to a PyTorch tensor and then applying an element-wise comparison against zero. The masked_fill method is then used to set to zero all the elements of the cross_effects tensor that correspond to the upper triangle of the array (including the diagonal). Finally, the sum_t tensor is calculated by summing the remaining elements of the cross_effects tensor along the last dimension.

The .sum(-2) operation is a tensor reduction operation that sums the elements of a tensor along a specified dimension. In this case, the .sum(-2) operation sums the elements of the cross_effects tensor along the second-to-last dimension, which has index -2.

The result of the .sum(-2) operation is a tensor with the same shape as the cross_effects tensor, except that the second-to-last dimension has size 1. For example, if the cross_effects tensor has shape [batch_size, seq_len, seq_len], the resulting tensor will have shape [batch_size, seq_len, 1].

The .sum(-2) operation is often used to reduce the size of a tensor by collapsing a specified dimension. For example, in this case the .sum(-2) operation is used to collapse the second-to-last dimension of the cross_effects tensor, summing all the elements along that dimension and creating a tensor with size [batch_size, seq_len].

```
    problem_bias = self.problem_base(problems).squeeze(dim=-1)
    skill_bias = self.skill_base(skills).squeeze(dim=-1)
```
This code calculates the bias

```
    prediction = (problem_bias + skill_bias + sum_t).sigmoid()
```
This code calculates the final prediction for each problem in the sequence. The prediction tensor is calculated by adding the problem_bias tensor (which captures the bias for each problem), the skill_bias tensor (which captures the bias for each skill), and the sum_t tensor (which captures the cumulative influence of all the previous problems on the prediction of the current problem). The resulting tensor is then passed through the sigmoid function to squash the values between 0 and 1. The prediction tensor has size [batch_size, seq_len].

sum_t: [64, 99]; x.embedding: [64, 99, 128] seq_len:99, delta_t:[64, 99, 99

### None value issue
```
    delta_t = (times[:, :, None] - times[:, None, :]).abs().double()
    delta_t = torch.log(delta_t + 1e-10) / np.log(self.time_log)
```
Yes, that is correct. The delta_t tensor is created by subtracting the time of each problem from the time of every other problem in the sequence, taking the absolute value of the result, and then log-transforming and normalizing the resulting tensor.

The times tensor is a 2D tensor with shape (batch_size, sequence_length), where batch_size is the number of time sequences in the batch and sequence_length is the length of each time sequence. The value at position (i, j) in the times tensor represents the time of the j-th event in the i-th time sequence in the batch.

The None keyword is used to add a new singleton dimension to the times tensor, resulting in a 3D tensor with shape (batch_size, sequence_length, 1). This allows the subtraction operation to be broadcast across the sequence_length dimensions, resulting in a 3D tensor with shape (batch_size, sequence_length, sequence_length) containing the time differences between all pairs of events in the times tensor.

The abs function is then applied to the resulting tensor to take the absolute value of the time differences, and the resulting tensor is converted to the double data type using the double function.

Finally, the log function is applied to the resulting tensor, adding a small constant value 1e-10 to each element to avoid taking the log of 0, and the resulting tensor is divided by the logarithm of self.time_log, which is a hyperparameter that you can adjust to control the scale of the resulting tensor. The resulting delta_t tensor has shape (batch_size, sequence_length, sequence_length) and contains the logarithm of the absolute time differences between all pairs of events in the times tensor, scaled by the logarithm of self.time_log.

```
    betas = torch.matmul(beta_src_emb, beta_target_emb.transpose(-2, -1))  # [bs, seq_len, seq_len]
    betas = torch.clamp(betas + 1, min=0, max=10)
```
In this code, the betas tensor is being calculated by performing a matrix multiplication between the beta_src_emb and beta_target_emb tensors. The beta_src_emb tensor represents the embeddings for the source (i.e., pre-requisite) skills, and the beta_target_emb tensor represents the embeddings for the target (i.e., current) skills. The matrix multiplication is performed using the .transpose() method, which rearranges the dimensions of the beta_target_emb tensor such that the second and third dimensions are switched.

After the matrix multiplication, the resulting betas tensor will have size [batch_size, sequence_length, sequence_length], where each element of the tensor represents the "strength" of the relationship between the corresponding source and target skills.

The betas tensor is then passed through the torch.clamp() function, which limits the values of the tensor to a certain range (in this case, the range [0, 10]). This is done to prevent the values of the betas tensor from becoming too large, which can cause problems when the tensor is used in further calculations.

### What does the mask do? ```mask = (x > 0).unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, x.size(1), 1).unsqueeze(1)```
In the code you provided, the mask tensor is being used to mask the attention computation in the transformer blocks. Attention mechanisms in transformer models compute a weighted sum of the values in a sequence, where the weights are based on the similarity between the query and each value in the sequence.

The mask tensor is used to specify which values in the sequence should be ignored when computing the attention weights. This can be useful for masking out padded tokens in the sequence, which are added to the end of the sequence to ensure that all sequences in a batch have the same length. Padded tokens do not contribute to the meaning of the input, so they should be excluded from the attention computation.

To create the mask tensor, the code first uses the > operator to create a boolean tensor indicating which elements in x are greater than zero. This boolean tensor has the same shape as x, with True values for the non-padded tokens and False values for the padded tokens.

The unsqueeze function is then used to add singleton dimensions to the boolean tensor, resulting in a tensor of shape [batch_size, 1, seq_len]. The repeat function is used to repeat this tensor along the second dimension, resulting in a tensor of shape [batch_size, seq_len, seq_len]. Finally, the unsqueeze function is used again to add another singleton dimension to the tensor, resulting in a final shape of [batch_size, 1, seq_len, seq_len].

When the mask tensor is used in the attention computation, the False values in the tensor will cause the attention weights for the padded tokens to be set to zero, effectively ignoring them in the attention computation.

### What's the difference between using proj_size=1 and nn.linear output size =1
The main difference between proj_size=1 and nn.Linear output size 1 is that proj_size=1 applies a linear transformation to the input data in the context of an attention mechanism, while nn.Linear output size 1 applies a linear transformation to the input data in the context of a neural network.
